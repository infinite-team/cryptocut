	<h1>CryptoCut</h1>
	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<h6>
	CryptoCut is an easy-to-use and user-friendly cross-platform application to communicate securely without wasting time. you can encrypt your message as easy as a keyboard shortcut and decrypt it with another one. the only thing you need is to sync your cipher codes to communicate securely through any safe and unsafe communication framework. CryptoCut let you to make a human-readable secure code with a high level of security. simple and easy to use for daily communications, if you care about your privacy. another important fact about this application GUI is build with QT based technology and all of widgets are native to your OS. Even you can set program service(daemon) as startup to inject privacy to your life. you can also open configs page with one click on tray icon.
